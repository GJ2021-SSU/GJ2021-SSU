Each room has 4 doors, (Up, Down, Left, Right). Going through those doors take you to a different room. 
The first room of the game is a Save Room that gives you a randomly generated path to follow. (An example path being [Up, Up, Left, Down, Right])

Following the path correctly takes you to the next room and eventually the next level. 
Failing to follow the path takes you back to the previous Save Room and generates a new path to follow.
